# Paper: SEC/ODT code
This paper will be submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software. 

## Directories
Due to the nature of the journal and the short length of the paper, the directory structure
here is slimmed down quite a bit from the template. The code to be submitted is located in its
repository at BYUignite/SEC.

### figures
We don't anticipate needing any figures in this paper, but this folder will be here just in
case.

- The manuscript Markdown file: `JOSS_ODT_SEC_paper.md`
- The references .bib file: `JOSS_ODT_SEC.bib`

### notes
This directory stores notes, files, or scripts that we want tracked but that don't fit
elsewhere in the repository structure. 

### submissions
This directory is a place to track different stages of the revision process, including
correspondence with co-authors and with journals.
