# Summary

Turbulent flows characterize the vast majority of fluid flows in practical engineering
applications. Simulations involving turbulent flows aid researchers in modeling existing
phenomena and discovering new applications `[@Pope:2000]`. In particular, simulations of
reacting turbulent flows, namely combustion, rely on accurate, yet computationally efficient
tubulence models to attain accurate results. 

Turbulence is characterized by the transfer of kinetic energy between flow structures,
sometimes called eddies, of various size. This energy transfer occurs over the entire range of
length and time scales in the flow. Theoretically, a turbulent flow can be described perfectly
by the Navier-Stokes equations. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) resolve the full range of
length and time scales numerically via the Navier-Stokes equations, but doing so requires
intense computational resources, and this approach is intractable for flows with large
Reynolds numbers. DNS is a powerful research tool, but cannot be applied to most flows in
practical engineering situations. 

There are numerous models that describe turbulence and turbulent flows in order to make
practical turbulent flow problems tractable. Large-eddy simulation (LES) models do this by
directly resolving large-scale flow structures and modelling small-scale motion. In flows that
are dominated by large flow structures and motion, LES approaches provide simulation data that
is accurate and computationally efficient to produce. In cases where small-scale flow
structures are important, however, LES can introduce inaccuracies that are difficult to find
and rectify because small-scale flow structures are extremely difficult to observe
experimentaly. One alternative to LES is the One-dimensional turbulence model (ODT). Instead
of preferentially resolving large-scale structures like LES does, ODT relies on models for
large-scale turbulent advection (which is relatively well-understood) and resolves small-scale
turbulent structures directly. In development and previous studies, ODT has been shown capable
of attaining simulation data with accuracy comparable to DNS at a fraction of the
computational cost, making it an attractive model for complex turbulent flows. 

In this paper, we present the Stochastic Eddy Cascade (SEC) package, the current
implementation of the one-dimensional turbulence model (ODT).
