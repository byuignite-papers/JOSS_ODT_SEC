@article{Echekki_2001,
Two-dimensional renderings of stirring events from a single realization show that ODT reproduces a number of salient features of simple developing turbulent shear flows that reflect the growth of the boundary layer and the mechanisms of turbulence cascade and spatial intermittency. Multiple realizations of jet simulations are used to compute axial and conditional statistics of streamwise velocity, major species, NO, and temperature. Comparison with experimental measurements indicates that chemical properties of interest can be captured by a model that involves a simplified representation of the flow structure. The results show. strong differential diffusion effects in the near field, with attenuation farther downstream.},
